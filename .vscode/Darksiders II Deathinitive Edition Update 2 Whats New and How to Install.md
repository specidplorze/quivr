If you are wondering whether Darksiders II Deathinitive Edition is worth playing or not, you might want to check out some reviews from critics and players. The game has received mostly positive feedback for its gameplay, graphics, sound, and content. However, some reviewers have also pointed out some flaws and drawbacks, such as repetitive combat, weak story, technical issues, and lack of innovation. Here are some excerpts from some reviews:

> "Darksiders 2: Deathinitive Edition brings the originalâs diverse world, interesting dungeons, and great loot system to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Sure, the story is dull, and there arenât any significant changes or additions to make this a must-buy for those who already played it on last-gen consoles or PC. But if you missed it the first time around, this is a great way to experience one of the best action-adventure games of the past decade." - IGN[^1^]

> "Darksiders II: Deathinitive Edition is a solid remaster of a game that deserves more attention than it got at launch. It's not perfect by any means - the combat can get tiresome, the story is forgettable, and the technical issues are annoying - but it's still a fun and engaging adventure that will keep you hooked for hours. The game offers a lot of content for its price, and the improved graphics and performance make it a worthwhile upgrade for fans of the original." - GameSpot

> "Darksiders II: Deathinitive Edition is a great game for those who love exploring vast worlds, collecting loot, solving puzzles, and slaying enemies. The game has a lot of variety and charm, and the protagonist Death is a cool and badass character. However, the game also has some problems that prevent it from being a masterpiece. The story is weak and clichÃ©d, the combat is repetitive and easy, the voice acting is mediocre, and the game has some bugs and glitches. The game is still enjoyable, but it could have been much better." - Steam User Review
