Here are some more details about the movie and its characters:
 
Chhota Bheem and the Curse of Damyaan is directed by Rajiv Chilaka, the creator of the Chhota Bheem TV series. The movie features the voices of Jigna Bhardwaj, Rupa Bhimani, Kaustav Ghosh, Rajesh Kava, Sabina Malik, Nandkishore Pandey, Arun Shekar, Julie Tejwani, and Anamaya Verma. The movie has a runtime of 88 minutes and a rating of U (Universal).
 
The movie begins with a flashback to centuries ago, when Damyaan, a sorcerer, was granted a wish to be immortal by the Book of Magi, a powerful artifact that contains the secrets of the universe. However, the wish came with a curse: Damyaan would be confined to the City of Sonapur, a hidden kingdom in the Himalayas. To escape from his prison and to unleash his dark arts over the world, Damyaan lures Raja Indravarma, the king of Dholakpur, with a map to the City of Gold.
 
Raja Indravarma sets out on an expedition with his army and his trusted advisor Guru Shambu. He also invites Chhota Bheem and his friends Chutki, Raju, Jaggu, Kalia, Dholu and Bholu to join him. Along the way, they encounter many dangers and obstacles, such as a giant snake, a snowstorm, and an avalanche. They also meet Singhala, a friendly yeti who helps them reach Sonapur.
 
However, as soon as they enter Sonapur, they fall into Damyaan's trap. Damyaan captures Raja Indravarma and his army and turns them into statues with his magic. He also reveals his plan to use the Book of Magi to open a portal to the underworld and summon an army of demons. He then challenges Chhota Bheem and his friends to a game: if they can defeat him in seven challenges within seven hours, he will free everyone and return to his prison. But if they fail or give up, they will also become statues and he will rule the world.
 
Chhota Bheem and his friends accept the challenge and face Damyaan in various tests of skill, strength, courage, and intelligence. They also discover that Damyaan has a weakness: he cannot touch water or he will lose his power. With the help of Singhala and Guru Shambu, they manage to overcome Damyaan's tricks and traps and reach the final challenge: a battle between Chhota Bheem and Damyaan.
 
In the climactic fight, Chhota Bheem uses his wit and bravery to defeat Damyaan by throwing him into a lake. The water dissolves Damyaan's body and destroys the Book of Magi. The portal to the underworld closes and all the statues come back to life. Raja Indravarma and his army thank Chhota Bheem and his friends for saving them and Sonapur. They also realize that Sonapur is not made of gold but of sandstone that reflects sunlight. They decide to leave Sonapur in peace and return to Dholakpur.
 
The movie ends with Chhota Bheem and his friends celebrating their victory with a song and dance.
